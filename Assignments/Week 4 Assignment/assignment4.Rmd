## Homework 1: Influence Functions and Breakdown Points

a) Derive the asymptotic and sample breakdown points of the sample median.

b) Simulate a sample of your choice. Use the sample to plot the empirical influence function of the median. When plotting, make sure that the limits of the x-axis are chosen in such a way that it covers the values in your original sample.

c) According to a) and b), is the sample median a robust estimator?
