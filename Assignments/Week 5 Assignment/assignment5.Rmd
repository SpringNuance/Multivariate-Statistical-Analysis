## Homework Problem 1: Frequency Analysis

The data `smoking.txt` contains a 2-dimensional frequency table, where the employees of a firm have been categorized according to their position (5 categories: SM = Senior Managers, JM= Junior Managers, SE = Senior Employees, JE = Junior Employees, SC = Secretaries). Furthermore, the smoking of the employees have 4 categories (None, Light, Medium, Heavy).

a) Form the theoretical frequencies under independence.

b) Calculate the attraction repulsion matrix.

c) Is smoking more frequent among a specific group in this company? Hint: Think about the complements of the different categories.
