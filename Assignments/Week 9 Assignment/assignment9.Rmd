## Homework Problem 1: Linear Discriminant Analysis

Perform the Fisher's linear discriminant analysis to the data set alcohol.txt. Suppose that we have a new drink with the following measurements: MEOH = 500, ACET = 400, BU1 = 3, MEPR = 30, ACAL = 20 and LNPRO1 = 10. Answer the following questions and provide the requested figure for part b).

a) Give the vector $a$, such that $\|a\|_2 = 1$.

b) Visualize the original data using a pairwise scatterplot. Add the new drink to the plot. Furthermore, use different colors for KIRSCH, MIRAB, POIRE and the new drink.

c) In which group will the new drink be classified to?
