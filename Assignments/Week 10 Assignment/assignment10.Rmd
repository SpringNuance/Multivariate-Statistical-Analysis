## Homework Problem 1: Hierarchical Clustering

Repeat steps (a)-(b) and (d)-(g) of Problem 1 for the iris data set. The data set can be accessed from the package MASS via the command: `data(iris)`. Leave out the variable species. Remember to provide figures related to (a), (e) and (f). In addition, answer the following:

h) Does the seed number affect the results in hierarchical clustering? Justify.

i) Which aggregation metric (single, complete, average) results in the best separation of the different species? Justify your answer using the dendrogram.
